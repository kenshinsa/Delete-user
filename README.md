# Delete-user
Recall that the Delete_User.sh script is highly interactive with the script’s user.
Therefore, it is important to include lots of verbiage to keep the script user informed about
what is going on during the script’s execution.
At the top of the script, the two functions get_answer and process_answer are
declared. The script then goes to the four steps of removing the user: obtaining and
confi rming the user account name, fi nding and killing the user’s processes, creating a
report of all fi les owned by the user account, and actually removing the user account.
